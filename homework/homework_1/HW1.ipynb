    "You may know from your experiences with matlab that you should always prefer vector- or matrix-based operations over for loops, if possible (hence the name **mat**(rix)**lab**(oratory)). The same is true of python -- you should prefer numpy-array-based operations over for loops. This will also be important for tensorflow -- as much as possible, you should avoid using python for loops when writing tensorflow code. To examine the impact of using for loops over numpy-array-based operations, for this question, you will exploit one of jupyter's built-in magic commands, `%timeit`:"

    "# Question 1b\n",
    "There are two main ways of computing convolutions digitally: 1) directly, using the definition of a convolution, and 2) using the convolution theorem that you proved in the written portion of this homework assignment (i.e., using ffts). Which method is more efficient depends on the sizes of the inputs. Let's use `%timeit` to compare the speeds for 1D convolutions using [`scipy.signal.convolve `](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.convolve.html). This function has an argument called \"method\", which can be set to \"direct\" or \"fft\", which correspond to (1) and (2) above. Use this function to convolve two random 1D signals of lengths $n=100, 500, 1000,$ and $2000$, and compare the speed of both methods. For which n do(es) method 1 outperform method 2, and vice versa? Can you make any generalizations based on these results about when one method outperforms the other?"

One common augmenting operation is to do random crops of the original image. For example, researchers designing neural networks for ImageNet, a dataset of natural RGB images, typically resize the images to 256x256x3 and then take a random 224x224x3 crop such that the latter fits entirely in the former.\n",
